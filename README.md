# **PYTHON FOR DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING**

### This repository basically contains all my solution to the exercises from the course - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## **PYTHON CRASH COURSE**

### This part of the program gives a basic introduction to Python as this is the language that will be used throughout the program. This part introduces some concepts such as the symbols for arithmetic operations in Python, and some methods to know - the _split_, _format_.

### The concept of list, dictionary, tuple, set and functions(users defined and anonymous) was also introduced.


## **PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS**

### This section of the program was divided into two; Python for Data Analysis - NumPy and Python for Data Analysis - Pandas, NumPy and Pandas were used respectively.

### **PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS - NUMPY**

### The NumPy lecture introduced the how arrays are create in NumPy, how arrays differ from the Python list, I got to know the difference between Vector(1-D array) and Matrix(2-D and above). The lectures in this section also introduced other things.

### **PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS - PANDAS**

### The Pandas library tagged as one of the most important libraries in Data Science and is built on NumPy. The Pandas Series and DataFrame acted as an eye-opener. In the later section of this part, data input and output was taught(reading in your data and also outputting data which has been worked on). The lectures in this section also introduced the methods and operations which can be performed using Pandas.

### For the exercises in this section, I worked on two datasets and I was to performed some querying/operations to get the same output as provided in the notebook.

## **PYTHON FOR DATA VISUALIZATION**

The Python for Data Visualization has five(5) sub-sections within it and different tools/ libraries were used in this four sections

### **PYTHON FOR DATA VISUALIZATION - MATPLOTLIB**

### The Matplotlib library was the first visualization tool used in this course, the library is built to replicate some functions of MATLAB.

### **PYTHON FOR DATA VISUALIZATION - SEABORN**

### The seaborn is an advanced plotting library which is built on Matplotlib, the seaborn library uses some methods of Matplotlib to make its plots and charts. 

### Seaborn offers easy, beautiful customization and appealing plot.

### **PYTHON FOR DATA VISUALIZATION - PANDAS BUILT-IN DATA VISUALIZATION**

### The Pandas built-in data viz tools can be used for quick overview of the data, this has most methods if not all methods of the plot style and calls Matplotlib under the hood to create some of its plot.

### The Pandas built-in data viz exercise was much fun to work on.

### **PYTHON FOR DATA VISUALIZATION - PLOTLY AND CUFFLINKS**

### This course happens to be the first time I will be working with Plotly and Cufflinks and was much fun. The Plotly library introduces interactiveness to the plot. Hovering round the plot shows values for each point of the plot. 

### Lecture on this visualization tool introduced a few plots such as the bar, scatter, line, histogram, surface(3d), bubble and scatter matrix.
